Title: Interactive Chessboard with Piece Movement Highlights
Problem Statement:
Build an interactive chessboard (8x8) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The chessboard must support the following functionality:

Display an empty 8x8 chessboard with alternating black and white cells.

Provide buttons for each chess piece (Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, and King) that the user can select.

Once a piece is selected, allow the user to hover over any square, and highlight all valid moves for that piece starting from the hovered square, based on standard chess rules.

Expected Features:
Chessboard:

Create a grid with 8 rows and 8 columns (64 cells total).

Alternate cell colors (like a standard chessboard).

Piece Selection:

Include buttons labeled with different piece names.

When a button is clicked, that piece becomes the "active" one for which moves are to be shown.

Move Highlighting:

When hovering over a square with a selected piece, show all valid move positions for that piece using visual highlighting.

Implement correct movement rules for:

Pawn: One step forward (no capturing or double move).

Rook: Horizontal and vertical.

Bishop: Diagonal.

Knight: "L" shaped moves.

Queen: Combination of rook and bishop.

King: One step in any direction.
