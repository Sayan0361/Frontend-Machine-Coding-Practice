# 🧠 Frontend Machine Coding Round – Chessboard Move Highlighter

## 📝 Problem Statement

Create an interactive **8x8 chessboard** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. Provide buttons or UI controls to select any chess piece (King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, Pawn). 

Once a piece is selected:
- When the user **hovers over any cell** on the board, highlight all the **valid moves** for that piece from the hovered position based on standard chess rules.

> 🔁 The move highlight should update dynamically when hovering over different cells.

---

## ✅ Functional Requirements

- Render a proper 8x8 chessboard with alternating black and white cells.
- Allow the user to select one chess piece at a time.
- On hovering over any cell:
  - Display possible valid moves using a highlight (e.g., colored cell).
- Implement movement logic for all the major chess pieces:
  - ♔ King
  - ♕ Queen
  - ♖ Rook
  - ♗ Bishop
  - ♘ Knight
  - ♙ Pawn (assume white pawn moving upwards)
